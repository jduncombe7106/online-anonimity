TOR was originally made to make yourself annoymous on the web so the goverment cannot snoop on you. however this is now used for other things like peadophillia. in a bbc newspage is has been reported that thousands of people have been using sites such a TOR to acces the dark net so trade photes and talk about being a peadofile.
